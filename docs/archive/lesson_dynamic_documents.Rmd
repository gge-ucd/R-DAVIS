# Basic RMarkdown Documents (`.Rmd`)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

There are loads of options within these `.Rmd` files, all largely based around how you format the **`yaml`** header within these documents. Much of this has been designed to make it easy to setup/customize as much or as little as you are interested in.

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Using [**flexdashboards**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)

These are very cool documents that are sort of like interactive and dynamic webpages. You can provide a number of different panels (customized as you like), which can display data in an interactive and exploratory way. 

# Creating your own CV

With just one added file (a template), and installing a program called LaTeX, it is possible to maintain/update your CV using RStudio and RMarkdown. Some folks have even developed templates for manuscripts and [dissertations](https://github.com/davharris/Davis-dissertation-template) using this method! What follows is an adaptation from Steven Miller's excellent [post](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/) and associated [code](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates) with a few formatting changes. 

**The following lesson/showcase will require 3 pieces:**  

 - Folks need to have a version of LaTeX installed, and it can take awhile, so if you don't already have it downloaded, please do so ahead of time if possible (here: http://www.latex-project.org/get/)  
 - You'll need the **`rap-latex-cv.tex`** file (the template that dictates how the PDF will look), you can download from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanpeek/markdown_cv/master/Rmarkdown/rap-latex-cv.tex)
 
 - And you'll need the actual **`template-2pg-cv.Rmd`** file, [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanpeek/markdown_cv/master/Rmarkdown/template-2pg-cv.Rmd).

### Important tips:

 - Use a new RStudio project for this (and everything, it makes things easier)
 - Make sure you have a **`LaTex`** distribution installed (see [here](http://www.latex-project.org/get/), note: it is a big file and will take a little time to install the first time)
 - Make sure in your RStudio global settings you have **`pdfLaTex`** selected in the Sweave options (see [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532257-Customizing-LaTeX-Options) for more info on checking this).
