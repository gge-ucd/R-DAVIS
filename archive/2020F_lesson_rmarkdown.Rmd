## Visualize & Communicate

If we consider the data science workflow we showed earlier, we've covered most of the steps, save the last few. The excellent [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/communicate-intro.html) online book by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham gives a nice run down of the various pieces that the last two steps may entail (**Visualization** and **Communication**). We'll use some examples from that book, along with some of additional code you may recognize from previous lessons.

## R Markdown

RMarkdown is an excellent tool that is built into RStudio. It provides many options and is a very flexible and powerful platform for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents, using the Markdown language. RStudio has some excellent resources for this, be sure to visit their site: <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can use RMarkdown as a digital notebook of all you've done or the code you've used, or you can write a more formal report that summarizes a project or experiment. This lesson won't cover everything (not even close!), but it should introduce you to some of the possibilities, and get you comfortable using RMarkdown inside RStudio.

### What's Markdown?

Markdown is plain text shorthand with a simple formatting syntax that can be easily translated or transformed into html formats. RStudio has some great references you can use, go to **Help** > **Markdown Quick Reference**, or checkout some of the fancy [cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).

### What's *Knitting?*

When you open a new `.Rmd` document, you'll get a basic template with some demo text and code. If you look for the **Knit** button at the top of the document, and click the small arrow just to the right of that button, you'll see a number of options for generating different document formats.

Just to the right of the **Knit** button, there's a gear wheel with a small arrow to the right. Click on the small arrow and notice the various output options...these help determine where your content will end up when you **Knit**, or run chunks of code in your Rmd. We can play with these and determine what is most preferable.

## Rmarkdown Components

### Code Chunks

The main advantage of using Rmarkdown vs. just markdown is that we can include R code chunks. Take a look at the RMarkdown default, and take a look at the [example Rmarkdown file](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html#r-markdown-basics) from **R for Data Science**. 

To add a code chunk, we can use the shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt/Option + i`: 

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(viridis) # let's use some color palette options!

# let's use a new dataset we haven't tried before "storms"
glimpse(storms)

ggplot(data=storms) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x=as.factor(month), y=pressure, fill=wind), 
              pch=21, alpha=0.5) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title="Hurricane Pressure vs. Month", 
       subtitle="with Max Win Speed", x="Month")

```

<div class = "blue">

### Challenge 

There are many options available inside a code chunk. How can we print our code but not evaluate it? Or print our plot but not our code?

*Bonus Challenge Question*: How can we suppress the package messages that print when we load a package?
</div>

### Weblinks

You can add links to your Rmd. To do so, there are two options. A full link can be included as is: 

 - **Full Link**: https://gge-ucd.github.io/R-DAVIS/data/gapminder.csv

Or to try hyperlinking a word or series of words, you can use the following syntax: 

 - `[the words you want to hyperlink](the.full.url.here)`
    - So, this is the [link to the gapminder csv](https://gge-ucd.github.io/R-DAVIS/data/gapminder.csv")

### Photos/Images

Similarly we can add photos, figures, gifs, embed youtube videos, etc. Really most anything we'd like to include.

For example, to include a figure from our computer, we use:

 - `![](path/to/figure.png)`  
 - ![demo_panel_plot](figures/plot2by1_11.png)

This works for gifs too!

 - ![](img/computer_lego.gif)  

Or if you want to embed a video, you can use the following code:

`<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7PCQ5vfCsZU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>`

<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7PCQ5vfCsZU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Equations & Formulas

Using a language called **`LaTeX`** we can embed formulas into our RMarkdown. You can do equations *inline* or as stand-alone formulas. The syntax requires a `$` on either side for *inline*, for example the following:

 - `This summation expression $\sum_{i=y}^n X_i$ appears inline.`

Will render like this: 

 - This summation expression $\sum_{i=y}^n X_i$ appears inline.
 
To make a formula, you can use the `$$` in front and at the end.

$$ \Sigma = \frac{\theta + y_{i}}{x + ab} $$
 

### Tables

Tables can be created as well, there are many flavors and packages you can use. This is just a quick sample of some of the options:

 - **`kable`**

This is part of the `knitr` package. It's handy and makes nice tables quickly:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

library(knitr)
kable(head(storms), caption = "Table with kable")

```

- **`htmltable`**

```{r}
htmlTable::htmlTable(head(storms))
```

 - **`DT`** (interactive tables)
 
```{r}
DT::datatable(storms)
```
 
Additional packages for creating tables include `stargazer` and `xtable`.

### Footnotes

 - We can include footnotes as well^[A footnote here for fun]

### Interactivity

There are many great interactive options available using RMarkdown and R code. Perhaps my most favorite is `plotly`. You can wrap most any `ggplot` with `ggplotly()` and make it interactive.

```{r}

# library(plotly)

plotly::ggplotly(
  ggplot(data=storms) + 
    geom_jitter(aes(x=as.factor(month), y=pressure, color=wind), 
                alpha=0.5) +
    scale_color_viridis_c() +
    theme_bw() + 
    labs(title="Hurricane Pressure vs. Month", 
         subtitle="with Max Win Speed", x="Month")
)

```

Other options include a great mapping package called `mapview`. Don't worry too much about the code here, but just be aware these are options for you to look into in the future.

```{r}

library(leaflet)

# filter data down 
storms <- filter(storms, year > 2006)

# set up a color palette:
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "RdYlBu",
  domain = storms$wind)

# make a map
m <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery", group = "ESRI Aerial") %>%
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldTopoMap", group = "Topo") %>%
  
# proposed sites
  addCircleMarkers(data=storms, group="Storms",
                   lng= ~long, lat= ~lat,
                   stroke=TRUE, weight=0.6, radius=4,
                   fillOpacity = 0.5, color=~pal(wind)) %>%
  
  # add controls for basemaps and data
  addLayersControl(
    baseGroups = c("ESRI Aerial", "Topo"),
    overlayGroups = c("Storms"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = T))

m

```

### Citations

There are also options for citations...you can add a `.bib` file in your YAML header. See [RStudio's demo](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) for a short overview.
